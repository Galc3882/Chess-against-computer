## Explanation of Project and Code
This project is a chess game that can be played against a computer, which uses the minimax algorithm to determine its moves. The game is implemented in C# using the Visual Studio Windows Forms development platform. The code is organized into several classes, including a ChessBoard class that represents the game board, a Piece class that represents a chess piece, and a ComputerPlayer class that uses the minimax algorithm to determine its moves.

## Special Considerations
This project requires a basic understanding of the rules of chess and the minimax algorithm. Additionally, the game is designed to be played on a Windows machine using the Visual Studio development environment.

## Examples
To play the game, simply run the application and follow the on-screen instructions. The game board will be displayed, and players can make moves by clicking on the appropriate squares.
